title: What is Dat?
intro: >-
  **Dat, The Protocol**


  The Internet is broken -- and we are using it to access and distribute all of
  human knowledge. Data monopolies hold and enclose upon personal & public
  datasets, threatening universal access. To tackle this problem, between 2013
  and 2015 we performed a series of design & development sprints in
  collaboration with researchers, librarians, and civic technologists working to
  preserve the digital knowledge commons. Out of this research we built Dat, a
  distributed ledger & peer-to-peer data sharing toolkit.


  Since 2013, the Dat community has led cutting-edge research and development.
  We took Unix-style programming to heart, designing our entire codebase as
  composable modules, and publishing everything as open-source from the first
  commit. Releasing early and often has allowed a healthy, bazaar-style
  ecosystem to evolve around our toolkit. 


  Dat combines the best of BitTorrent and Git. From BitTorrent, we took the
  scaling properties of peer-to-peer: downloads get faster rather than slower as
  more people join the network. From Git, we took mutability: the original
  publisher can add or modify data while peers can keep a full history for
  auditing and preservation. Dat is unique in the rapidly growing area of
  decentralized web, blockchain, and other cryptocurrency projects. It was the
  first in the field with a public interest focus. 


  There are a [wide variety of core mission partners that are developing
  applications ](https://dat.foundation/explore/projects/)that use the dat://
  protocol, including a web browser for developing peer-to-peer websites (Beaker
  Browser), a community-based mapping and monitoring application (Mapeo), a
  cooperatively-owned data infrastructure (Cobox), and a privacy-oriented chat
  application (Cabal). Independently, these applications show the power and
  flexibility of the protocol for building the next-generation Web. 


  **Dat, The Foundation**


  The Dat Protocol Foundation is a small non-profit group, fiscally sponsored by
  the US-based 501(c)(3) Code For Science & Society. The Foundation provides
  grants focusing on adoption and development of the Dat Protocol. It houses
  social and technical infrastructure for the working groups that enhance the
  protocol and grow the community. We've received about $1.7 million in funding
  from a variety of sources, especially from large foundation grants. 


  The Dat Protocol Foundation gives grants as part of it's Community Grants
  program in three main focus areas:


  \* **Community Management:** Facilitation, community engagement, social
  infrastructure, and events.


  \* **User Experience:** Improving the user experience through guides,
  documentation, and responding to inquiries.


  \* **Technical Research & Development:** Creating new modules, researching new
  approaches, and maintenance.


  At the scale of the web, every decision can have a massive impact on our
  political systems and social well-being. To this end, development of the
  protocol is driven entirely by contributors from external organizations,
  keeping it neutral and flexible. The Dat Protocol Foundation working groups
  cover the full spectrum of organization types, including non-profit
  organizations, for-profit companies, and individual contributors. Our diverse
  organizational participants guide development in the direction of maximum
  public benefit.
