  testing!




  Dat is a community-driven project for distributed data syncronization. The Dat
  Foundation imagines a web of commons created by global communities on open and
  secure protocols. We set out to improve access to public data and [created a
  new protocol](https://www.datprotocol.com/) along the way. In our work on
  developing Dat, we found a under-served need. User-driven software has
  potential to return control of digital information to the people. Today,
  building peer-to-peer applications presents both technical and ethical
  challenges but Dat is slowly changing that.


  To encourage people to experiment and innovate with peer-to-peer technology,
  we aim to make Dat foundational software for peer-to-peer applications â€“ one
  that is sponsored by a mission-driven nonprofit. To realize this future, we
  aim to make Dat good at supporting the core needs of peer-to-peer
  applications. We hope that with our small but critical focus, we can create a
  strong building block for the Dat ecosystem.

  The first code went into Dat [on August 17,
  2013](https://github.com/datproject/dat/commit/e5eda57b53f60b05c0c3d97da90c10cd17dcbe19).
  Throughout its history, Dat has had a primary focus on Dat sharing in civic
  data and research, only recently with a wider focus on more general user-owned
  applications. Dat has been almost exclusively funded by [grants from private
  foundations](https://blog.datproject.org/2017/09/15/dat-funding-history/).
